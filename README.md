# Assignment-5

In this assignment my aim was to build an app in which I can demonstrate conditional rendering, routing and some list views.

I used some custom functional components to achieve these goals.

## The Components
- Homepage
- Secondpage
- ImageController

These are all custom components that I have designed and they are pretty much self explainatory. I have also written some comments about these components so you can check them out if you want to.

## Screenshots
